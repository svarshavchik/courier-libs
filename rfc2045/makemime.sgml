    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>
<command>makemime</command> creates MIME-formatted messages of arbitrary
complexity.
<command>makemime</command> reads one or more individual files,
MIME-encodes them, adds basic MIME headers, and adds any additional headers
specified by command line options. The result is saved to another file or
standard output. Complex MIME-formatted messages are created by piping together
multiple instances of <command>makemime</command>.
Advanced options direct <command>makemime</command> to
<function>fork</function>() itself, and handle the details of setting up all
the pipelines.</para>

    <para>
In most cases, options for <command>makemime</command> come directly from the
command line. @<filename>filename</filename> reads the options from a file.
"<literal>@&amp;<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal>" reads options from a pipe
on file descriptor #<replaceable>n</replaceable>.
"<literal>@-</literal>" is a shortcut for
"<literal>@&amp;0</literal>", which reads options from standard input.</para>

    <para>
When options are read from a file or a pipe, each option must be on a
line by itself. If an option requires an argument, the argument must follow
on the next line.</para>

    <para>
For readability, leading whitespace is deleted when options
are read from a file or a pipe. Empty lines are also ignored, as well as lines
that begin with the '<token>#</token>' character.</para>

    <para>
Options and their arguments may contain characters that are special
characters to the shell, such as '<token>(</token>' and '<token>)</token>'.
These characters must be backslashed when specified on the command line, to
avoid their special meaning to the shell.
These characters MUST NOT be backslashed when options are read
from a file or a pipe. Similarly, the contents of most headers nearly always
include spaces.  Therefore they must be quoted when specified on the command
line.  Header contents MUST NOT be quoted when options come from a file or a
pipe.</para>

    <para>
      <command>makemime</command> reads the content to be formatted
      as a MIME message from some other file.
      The files can also be a pipe. It is possible to supply both the
      options and a file from the same pipe, by terminating the options
      list with a line containing the single character "-".
      The remainder of the pipe will be
      available to be used as an input file (which must be explicitly specified
      by one of the options). Of course, only one input file can come from a
      single pipe.
    </para>

    <para>
      For this to work the file with the option gets opened with a specific
      file descriptor, and then the options are read from that file descriptor:
    </para>

    <blockquote>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
	  # Open options.txt on file descriptor 3,
	  # then specify that options
	  # are read from file descriptor 3.
	  # Quote special shell character "&amp;"

	  makemime "@&amp;3" 3&lt;options.txt
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
    </blockquote>

    <para>
      With <filename>options.txt</filename> contents:
    </para>

    <blockquote>
      <informalexample>
	<programlisting>
	  -c
	  auto

	  -C
	  utf-8

	  -N
	  text8bit

	  # options.txt is opened on file descriptor 3, read this MIME
	  # section starting after the - terminator

	  &amp;3
	  -
[contents of the MIME section]
	</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

<title>MIME overview</title>

      <para>
A MIME-formatted message contains one or several MIME sections. MIME headers
specify how multiple MIME sections are to be interpreted as a whole (whether
they are attached together; whether they are alternative representations of
the same content; or something even more esoteric). This manual page gives a
very brief, terse, overview of basic MIME concepts. The description is biased
towards describing the functionality of the <command>makemime</command>
utility.

<ulink url="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt">RFC 2045</ulink>,

<ulink url="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2048.txt">RFC 2049</ulink>
for a formal definition of MIME-formatted messages.</para>

      <para>
Each file in a MIME message is encoded as a single MIME section. A MIME
section consists of at least one header line,
"<literal>Content-Type:</literal>".
The "<literal>Content-Type:</literal>" header gives the type of the data
ontained in the file. Other header lines may also be present.
Their relative order does not matter. MIME
headers are followed by a blank line, then the contents of the file, encoded
appropriately.
All MIME sections generated by <command>makemime</command> will always
contain another header,
"<literal>Content-Transfer-Encoding:</literal>". This header gives the
encoding method used for the file; it is an optional header, but
<command>makemime</command> always creates it.</para>

      <para>
The MIME encoding method defaults to
"<literal>7bit</literal>" if this header is absent.
<literal>7bit</literal>
encoding is only suitable for plain text messages in the US-ASCII character
set.
The "<literal>8bit</literal>" encoding method is used by plain text messages
in other character sets that use octets with the high bit set. An
alternative to 8bit encoding is
"<literal>quoted-printable</literal>". The "<literal>base64</literal>" encoding
method is used for files containing binary data (anything other than plain
text).</para>

      <para>
MIME sections that contain text messages have their
"<literal>Content-Type:</literal>" header
set to "<literal>text/plain</literal>";
or "<literal>text/html</literal>" for HTML messages.
There are also several
other, rare, content types that can be used. MIME sections that contain other
kinds of data will use some other, appropriate
"<literal>Content-Type:</literal>" header, such as
"<literal>image/gif</literal>", or "<literal>audio/x-wav</literal>".</para>

      <para>
MIME sections that contain textual content may also use the
<literal>base64</literal> encoding
method, they are not required to use <literal>7bit</literal>,
<literal>8bit</literal>, or <literal>quoted-printable</literal>.
"<literal>text/pdf</literal>" sections, that contain PDF files,
typically contain binary data
and must use the <literal>base64</literal> encoding.
Consequently, MIME sections that typically
contain binary data, such as
<literal>image/gif</literal> and <literal>audio/x-wav</literal>,
are free to use
encodings other than <literal>base64</literal>, as long as all the data can
be represented by
printable characters (but, in practice, that never happens).</para>

      <para>
MIME sections may also contain other, optional, headers such as
"<literal>Content-Disposition:</literal>",
"<literal>Content-ID:</literal>", and "<literal>Content-Name:</literal>".
Consult the
appropriate RFCs for the specific usage of these headers. These headers can be
added by <command>makemime</command> by using the
<option>-a</option> option, as described below. These
headers play no part in creating the overall structure of a MIME-encoded
message, and <command>makemime</command> does not care much about these
headers. It simply
includes them, and their content, upon request.</para>

      <para>
Multiple files are formatted as a single MIME message in two steps:
first, by creating a MIME section for each file;
and then creating a single MIME section that contains other MIME sections.
A "<literal>multipart/mixed</literal>" MIME section contains a
collection of MIME sections that represent different objects, attached
together.
A "<literal>multipart/alternative</literal>" MIME section contains a
collection of MIME
sections which are alternative representations of the same object, such as an
HTML and a plain text version of the same message. Other "multipart" MIME
sections also exist, and their usage is defined by their respective
RFCs.</para>

      <para>
The <option>-c</option> option reads <filename>filename</filename>,
encodes it appropriately, adds the
"<literal>Content-Type: <replaceable>type</replaceable></literal>" and
"<literal>Content-Transfer-Encoding:</literal>" MIME headers, then writes the
result to standard output. <literal>type</literal> can be any valid MIME type,
except for <literal>multipart</literal>.
Setting <filename>filename</filename> to "<literal>-</literal>"
reads from standard input.
Setting <filename>filename</filename> to "&amp;<replaceable>n</replaceable>"
reads from file descriptor #<replaceable>n</replaceable>.</para>

      <para>
The <option>-C</option> option sets the MIME <literal>charset</literal>
attribute for <literal>text/plain</literal> content. The <option>-N</option>
option sets the <literal>name</literal> attribute for
<literal>Content-Type:</literal>.</para>

      <para>
<replaceable>encoding</replaceable> argument should be specified. It's more
efficient to do so. <replaceable>encoding</replaceable> must be one of the
following:
<literal>7bit</literal>, <literal>8bit</literal>,
<literal>quoted-printable</literal>, or <literal>base64</literal>.</para>

      <para>
If <replaceable>encoding</replaceable> is not specified,
<command>makemime</command>
reads the <filename>filename</filename> twice - once to figure out the best
encoding method, and the second time to encode <filename>filename</filename>.
If <filename>filename</filename> is a pipe <command>makemime</command>
creates a temporary file, which is not very efficient if
<filename>filename</filename> is large.
However letting <command>makemime</command> pick the encoding method
is more convenient if <filename>filename</filename> is relatively small.</para>

      <para>
Another possibility is to omit <replaceable>encoding</replaceable> and set
<replaceable>type</replaceable> to <literal>auto</literal>.
This combination sets "<literal>Content-Type:</literal>" to either
<literal>text/plain</literal>, or
<literal>application/octet-stream</literal>, based on the selected
<replaceable>encoding</replaceable>.</para>

      <para>
By default the encoded MIME section is written to standard output.
The <option>-o</option> option writes the MIME section to
<replaceable>outputfile</replaceable>. <replaceable>outputfile</replaceable> may be
"&amp;<replaceable>n</replaceable>",
which writes the MIME section to a pipe on file descriptor
#<replaceable>n</replaceable>.</para>

      <para>
<command>makemime</command> does not generate any other headers.
Particularly, the
"<literal>Mime-Version:</literal>" header is required for
MIME-formatted E-mail messages. Additional headers are specified by the
<option>-a</option> option, which may be used
multiple times to insert multiple headers.
<command>makemime</command> doesn't do anything
with them except to insert the headers into the generated MIME section.</para>

      <para>Note that
"<literal>Mime-Version:</literal>" is only required for the top level
MIME section.
This header is not required for individual MIME sections that are later
combined into a multipart MIME collection.</para>

      <note>
	<para>
The <option>-c</option> option must occur listed first, the remaining
options must follow the <option>-c</option> option.</para>

<replaceable>type</replaceable> must be either
"<literal>multipart/mixed</literal>",
"<literal>multipart/alternative</literal>", or
some other MIME multipart content type. There is no explicit encoding. Also:
<filename>filename</filename> must be a MIME-formatted section, NOT a regular
file. Usually
<filename>filename</filename> is created by a previous
invocation of <command>makemime</command> (it can also be a pipe, like
the <option>-c</option> option), but it can be created via any other
means.</para>

      <para>
The <option>-m</option> option creates an initial multipart MIME collection,
that contains
only one MIME section, taken from <filename>filename</filename>.
The collection is written to standard output, or the pipe or
to <replaceable>outputfile</replaceable>.</para>

      <para>
This option adds a MIME section to an existing MIME collection.
<replaceable>file1</replaceable> must be a MIME collection that was

<replaceable>file2</replaceable> must be a MIME section that was previously
created by the <option>-c</option> option.
The <option>-j</option> options adds the MIME section in
<replaceable>file2</replaceable> to the MIME collection in
<replaceable>file1</replaceable>.  The result is written to standard output
or to <replaceable>outputfile</replaceable>.</para>

      <para>

<replaceable>file1</replaceable> and/or <replaceable>file2</replaceable> may
be
"<literal>@&amp;<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal>" which reads from
file descriptor #<replaceable>n</replaceable>.
The <replaceable>outputfile</replaceable>
may also specify a file descriptor.</para>

      <para><replaceable>file1</replaceable> and
<replaceable>file2</replaceable> should ideally be created by
<command>makemime</command> as well.
It's also possible to use MIME-formatted files created by other software, but
with some degree of care. <command>makemime</command> is not intended to be a
MIME parser, but a MIME generator. However some amount of MIME parsing is
necessary to append a MIME section to an existing MIME collection.
<command>makemime</command>'s parsing is sufficient
for appending a new section to a MIME collection, as long as the
MIME headers in the MIME collections are straightforward. Very convoluted MIME
headers may confuse <command>makemime</command>, and it may not be able to
handle them.</para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2 id="makemime_recursive_mime_collections">
<title>Recursive MIME collections</title>

      <para>
MIME collection may contain other MIME collections as well as MIME
sections. The <option>-m</option> and the <option>-j</option> options may use
a multipart MIME collection in place of a MIME section automatically
because a multipart MIME collection is just a special type of a MIME section.
The following example
encodes a text message that can be alternatively represented as HTML or plain
text, with some additional attachments:</para>

      <para>
1. Create a MIME collection that has a
<literal>text/plain</literal> and a <literal>text/html</literal> MIME
section.</para>

      <para>
2. Create a MIME collection consisting of the MIME section generated in
step one, plus additional MIME sections containing other attachments.</para>

      <para>For example:</para>
      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting format="linespecific">
# Take two files containing the text and the html version of a message, and
# add MIME headers to them.

makemime -c "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1" -o tmp1.txt msg.txt
makemime -c "text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" -o tmp1.html msg.html

# Combine the result into a multipart/alternative collection

makemime -m "multipart/alternative" -a "Content-Disposition: inline" \
                                    -o tmp.ma1 tmp1.txt
makemime -j tmp.ma1 -o tmp.ma2 tmp1.html

# Add MIME headers to an image attachment.

makemime -c "image/gif" -a "Content-Disposition: attachment" \
                        -o tmp2.gif attachment.gif

# Create the final multipart/mixed collection

makemime -m "multipart/mixed" -a "Mime-Version: 1.0" \
                              -o tmp.mm1 tmp.ma2
makemime -j tmp.mm1 -o output.msg tmp2.gif
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
<filename>output.msg</filename> now contains the complete MIME collection.
Just add the
<literal>Subject:</literal>, <literal>From:</literal>, and
<literal>To:</literal> headers (can also be done by additional
<option>-a</option> options, of
course), and send it on its way.</para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2 id="makemime_building_complex_mime_encodings">
      <title>Building complex MIME encodings</title>

      <para>
There are several different ways to build complete MIME encodings from
multiple MIME sections.  One way is to use temporary files to create MIME
sections, then combine them together into a single MIME collection. A slightly
more complicated approach involves setting up pipes between multiple makemime
processes, in order to avoid using temporary files.</para>

      <para>This can be done manually, by hand. It is also possible to have
<command>makemime</command> do this automatically. <command>makemime</command>
will set up these pipes and run multiple instances of itself to create a
single MIME collection, with
multiple attachments of complexity limited only by your system's limit on
the maximum number of open files and pipes.</para>

      <para>
Any file that's read by the
<option>-c</option>,
<option>-m</option>,
and
<option>-j</option>
options (
<option>-o</option>
specifies a file to
create, and doesn't count) may be replaced by a single argument containing a
left parenthesis, additional options, then a single argument containing a
right parenthesis.
A single invocation of <command>makemime</command> can only use one
<option>-c</option>, <option>-m</option>, or <option>-j</option> option.
However, another <option>-c</option>, <option>-m</option>, or
<option>-j</option> option may be specified
inside the left and the right parenthesis, and its output is used in place of
the file it replaced.  In the previous example the third and the fourth
invocation of <command>makemime</command> can be replaced with the following
command:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting format="linespecific">
makemime -j \(                                           \
               -m "multipart/alternative"                \
               -a "Content-Disposition: inline" tmp1.txt \
             \) -o tmp.ma2                               \
             tmp1.html
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
Note that the parenthesis must be backslashed, to avoid their special
meaning to the shell. An equivalent argument file would have the following
contents:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting format="linespecific">
-j
   (
      -m
          multipart/alternative
      -a
          Content-Disposition: inline
      tmp1.txt
   )
   -o
      tmp.ma2
 tmp1.html
</programlisting>
	</informalexample>
      </blockquote>

      <para>
These constructs can be arbitrarily nested, and are limited by the amount
of available memory and resources.  The entire sequence in the previous
section is equivalent to the following command:</para>

      <blockquote>
	<informalexample>
	  <programlisting format="linespecific">
