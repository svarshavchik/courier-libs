#
# DEBUG_LOGIN=0   - turn off login debugging
# DEBUG_LOGIN=1   - turn on login debugging
# DEBUG_LOGIN=2   - turn on login debugging + log passwords too
#
# Note that most information is sent to syslog at level 'debug', so
# you may need to modify your /etc/syslog.conf to be able to see it.

##NAME: AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL:0
#
# Uncomment this setting to automatically create a home directory on first
# login. if the AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL environment variable is set, and the
# home directory does not exist, the home directory gets created, with its
# initial contents copied from AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL which must be a directory,
# typically /etc/skel.
#
# Note that this must be a complete home directory structure, including
# the maildir. Typically:
#
# mkdir /etc/skel
# chmod 700 /etc/skel
# maildirmak /etc/skel/Maildir
#
# This directory gets copied as is, preserving each file/subdirectory's
# permissions, with only userid/groupid changed to match the account's.
#
# AUTH_MKHOMEDIR_SKEL=/etc/skel

#
# If the first search does not return anything, the second one is tried.
#
# Each occurence of @ is replaced by the search key
#
# You may provide your own settings below.

##NAME: SENDMAIL_ARGUMENTS:0

#
# SENDMAIL_ARGUMENTS='-oi -t -f "$1"'

SENDMAIL_ARGUMENTS='$DSN -f "$1"'
